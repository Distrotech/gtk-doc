It is typically used to document the public\r\nAPI of libraries, such as the GTK+ and GNOME libraries, but it can also be\r\nused to document application code.\r\n\r\nNote that GTK-Doc wasn't originally intended to be a general-purpose\r\ndocumentation tool, so it can be a bit awkward to setup and use.\r\nFor a more polished general-purpose documentation tool you may want to look\r\nat Doxygen (http://www.doxygen.org/). However GTK-Doc has some special code\r\nto document the signals and properties of GTK+ widgets and GObject classes\r\nwhich other tools may not have.\r\n\r\nGTK-Doc allows your documentation to be written in 2 ways:\r\n  a) Embedded inside the source code in specially-formatted comments.\r\n or\r\n  b) Added to the 'template' files which gtk-doc outputs after scanning all\r\n     the header files and parsing the declarations (deprecated now).\r\n\r\nFrom these source code comments and template files GTK-Doc generates a Docbook\r\nXML (or SGML) document, which is then transformed into HTML.\r\nThe generated HTML documentation can be browsed in an ordinary web browser or\r\nby using the special Devhelp API browser\r\n(see http://developer.imendio.com/wiki/Devhelp).\r\n\r\nPlease don't use template files in new projects. Support for for those will\r\nbe removed at some point in the future (together with gtkdoc-mktmpl). Please\r\nalso use DoxBook XML instead of DocBook SGML. \r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n============\r\n\r\nPerl v5 - the main scripts are in Perl.\r\n    http://www.perl.com/\r\n\r\n\r\nFor XML output (recommended):\r\n\r\nThe DocBook XML DTD.\r\n    http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/\r\n\r\nThe DocBook XSL Stylesheets.\r\n    http://docbook.sourceforge.net/projects/xsl/\r\n\r\nlibxslt & libxml2 >= 2.3.6.\r\n    http://xmlsoft.org/\r\n\r\n\r\nFor SGML output (not actively maintained any more):\r\n\r\nThe DocBook SGML DTD.\r\n    http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/\r\n\r\nJade v1.1 or OpenJade 1.3.1.\r\n    http://www.jclark.com/jade\r\n    http://sourceforge.net/projects/openjade\r\n\r\nThe DocBook DSSSL Stylesheets (I've got 1.40, but v1.19+ may be OK).\r\n    I've customized the DSSSL code slightly, in gtk-doc.dsl, to colour\r\n    the program code listings/declarations, and to support global\r\n    cross-reference indices in the generated HTML.\r\n    http://docbook.sourceforge.net/projects/dsssl/\r\n\r\n\r\nMost distributions now have packages for all of these, so I would strongly\r\nadvise that you grab those.\r\n\r\nSee the documentation in the help/manual directory for more information. You can\r\nread it e.g. with yelp file://$PWD/help/manual/C/gtk-doc-manual.xml\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
